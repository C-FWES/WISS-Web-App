# What is it?
Project Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_VqjWfVA4c
This competition was for students to develop a knowledge base which contained details about Ontario universities and programs/courses. The competition was looking for students to come up with creative ways to adress the needs of WISS. There was a preliminary qualifying round for the finals, and in the final there would be four final teams in a final competition. Our team was the first to make the finals, but we finished second in the final round.
